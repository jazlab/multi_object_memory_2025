# Figures

## Introduction

This directory contains code to produce all figures in our paper. Each folder
here corresponds to one figure. Those beginning `figure_$n` are main text
figures, whereas those beginning `supp_fig_...` are supplementary figures.

## Reproducing our results

Before reproducing our figures, you must install the necessary dependencies and
download our data. See `../README` for instructions on how to do these. Once you
have fone that, you can reproduce our figures.

Each figure folder contains an Adobe Illustrator file for that figure, as well
as a jpeg version of the figure. The illustrator file has embedded PDF images,
which are generated by Jupyter notebooks in the figure folder.

Each figure folder has one or multiple notebooks in it to generate the PDFs for
the illustrator files. All figure panels are generated by these notebooks. To
reproduce a figure, find the notebooks in the figure's folder and run them. For
some figures, these notebooks may be in sub-folders corresponding to different
panels. All non-notebook files are either supporting code called by the
notebooks (e.g. data loaders) or code to generate cached data (which you don't
need to run since you've downloaded our cached data).
