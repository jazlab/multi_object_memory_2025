# Behavior Processing

This directory contains tools to process behavior and task data. The entrypoint
is `run_cache_data.py`. Run that script to process behavior and task data and to
cache processed dataframes in `../cache/behavior/`.

Note: This GitHub directory already contains the cached data, so there is no
need to re-run this script if you have cloned the entire repo.
