# Note on single neuron PSTHs

We have not included code to reproduce the single-neuron PSTHs plots, because
this relies on large model snapshots that we have not included in the cache. If
you want to reproduce the single-neuron PSTHs plots, you may re-run the models
in `../../phys_modeling` and generate the PSTHs from the resulting snapshots.
